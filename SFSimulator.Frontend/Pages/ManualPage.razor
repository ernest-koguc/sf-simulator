### How to simulate progress
On the main page you can simulate your character progress. 
To do it you need to provide all necessary character information together with gameplay strategy, e.g. character level, class, how much thirst every day and similar.
To make it easier there is option to poll your character information via SF Tools endpoint.
Once you have all the information you can start the simulation by clicking the "Simulate" button.
The result of simulation depending on the device will be displayed on the left/bottom of the screen.
